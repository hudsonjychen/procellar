# Introduction

**Procellar** is a part of a framework for embedding analyst-defined process scopes into object-centric event log (OCEL). You can learn more about our initiative in our paper.

Submitted to the [10th International Workshop on Process Querying, Manipulation, and Intelligence (PQMI 2025)](http://processquerying.com/pqmi2025/)

The name **Procellar** /ˈproʊ.sə.lɚ/ is derived from a combination of *process-enriched OCEL* and *stellar*.
The word stellar reflects our vision of creating a brilliant, high-quality tool for working with event data.
