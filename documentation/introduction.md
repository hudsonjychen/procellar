# Introduction

Procellar is a complementary tool for a Process-Level Aggregation language. The concept and the language can be seen on our paper. 
"Process-Level Aggregation and Analysis of Object-Centric Event Data"

Submitted to the 10th International Workshop on Process Querying, Manipulation, and Intelligence (PQMI 2025)

*Procellar* comes from the combination of Process-enriched OCEL and Stellar. Stellar takes our vision of making a shinning tool for this project.
